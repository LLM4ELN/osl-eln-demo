Initial state: Gray input node with user text for Chapter 1

Chapter 1: Experiment #1
[initial] Gray input node: "A tensile test experiment #1 conducted by Dr. Jane Doe, Example Lab Corp."
+ new Node e (extracting from input), dashed edge from input1 to e (no label), edge "type" from e to eC (new class node "LaboratoryProcess")
+ new Node p "Dr. Jane Doe, Example Lab Corp." while e text changes to "A tensile test experiment #1", edge "actionee" from e to p
+ new Node pC "Person" (class), edge "type" from p to pC
+ new Node o "Example Lab Corp." while p text changes to "Dr. Jane Doe", edge "organization" from p to o
+ new Node oC "Organization" (class), edge "type" from o to oC

[pause]

Chapter 2: Experiment #2
+ Gray input node: "A tensile test experiment #2 conducted by Dr. John Doe, Example Lab Corp."
+ new Node e2 (extracting from input), dashed edge from input2 to e2 (no label), edge "type" from e2 to eC
+ new Node p2 "Dr. John Doe, Example Lab Corp." while e2 text changes to "A tensile test experiment #2", edge "actionee" from e2 to p2, edge "type" from p2 to pC
+ new Node o2 "Example Lab Corp." while p2 text changes to "Dr. John Doe", edge "organization" from p2 to o2, edge "type" from o2 to oC
+ edge from o2 to o "sameAs"
+ o2 merges into o while removing edge "sameAs" (identified as same organization)

[pause]

Chapter 3: Experiment #3
+ Gray input node: "A tensile test experiment #3 conducted by Dr. John Doe, Manager of Example Lab Corp."
+ new Node e3 (extracting from input), dashed edge from input3 to e3 (no label), edge "type" from e3 to eC
+ new Node p3 "Dr. John Doe, Manager of Example Lab Corp." while e3 text changes to "A tensile test experiment #3", edge "actionee" from e3 to p3, edge "type" from p3 to pC
+ edge from p3 to p2 "sameAs"
+ p3 merges into p2 while removing edge "sameAs" (identified as same person)
+ p2 label updated to "Dr. John Doe", edge "manager" from o to p2, o marked as "modified" (yellow border)
+ e3 and o marked as "stored" (black border)

Node Types:
- Gray (#999): Input node (user text in quotes)
- Green (#69b3a2): Instance node (extracted entity)
- Pink (#ff9999): Class node (type classification)

Implementation Requirements:
- Initial state shows the first input node (gray), not an empty graph
- Each chapter starts with a gray input node showing the user text in quotes
- Input nodes remain visible and are linked to experiment nodes via dashed edges (no labels)
- Transitions within each step run in parallel
- Auto-start GIF recording on page load
- "Restart Animation" button to reset and restart (works even during animation)
- "Record GIF" button to record and download as GIF
- Panning and zooming possible during animation
- Speed slider (0.25x to 3x) to adjust animation speed
- Chapter pauses between experiments for visual separation
- Animation generation tracking ensures clean restarts without leftover state
- Sequence is defined as importable data structure (not hardcoded)
